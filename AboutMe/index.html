			<div class="content"><p>I was Born in Germany on the 9th of July 1990 where I was raised until the age of 17 when my family moved to Tenerife. This is why I  am fluent in both written and spoken German and English and have a basic knowledge of Spanish.</p>
<p>I went on a mission to Burundi (Africa) with <a href="http://btbab.org" target="_blank">"Blessed to be a Blessing"</a> last summer. My main task there was to keep the children entertained while their parents were examined by the rest of the team. I also thought some basic electronics to teenagers, building a circuit with them that lights up if you touch both ends.</p>
<p>I have successfully been trained and have attained a certified license by PADI as a rescue diver in 2007.</p>
