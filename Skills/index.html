	<h2>Engineering</h2>
	<p>Having studied Robotics I have a good knowledge of basic electronics, design of embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence. I learned how to carry a robot from conception all the way to a working prototype with all its aspects of hardware and software design. <i>For a full list of modules see the <a href="../Education">Education section</a>.</i></p>
	<p>As part of my studies I spent one year on placement at <a href="http://visteon.com" target="_blank">Visteon</a> as a Systems Engineer where I learned a lot about how to work with other teams, getting the specifications for them in an unambiguous form to enable them to quickly produce accurate results, and about negotiating with customers, since I was flying to Paris every couple of weeks to resolve issues with Renault directly and to demonstrate prototypes.</p>

	<h2>Web design/development</h2>
	<p>I started out with creating my fathers first business website in iWeb in 2004 and I have come a long way since. After switching to Adobe Dreamweaver for a while I now like to hand-code everything myself, and <a href="http://panic.com/coda/" target="_blank">Coda 2</a> is my software of choice to do so.</p>
	<p>This means that I cannot only design the front end of the website but also create the backend to produce responsive and easy to update websites.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
		<li>HTML5</li>
		<li>CSS3</li>
		<li>SASS</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>PHP</li>
		<li>MySQL</li>
		<li>Wordpress</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Photography</h2>
	<p>I always loved taking photos with my fathers’ camera and at the age of fourteen I got my first DSLR and what started out as a hobby has turned into freelance work. I love to photograph people in the moment and not in a big staged setup, which is how I started with event photography and then moved on to weddings. I started out with nature photography as this gave me more time to compose the pictures and I still carry my camera around with me to this day on trips and hikes. This has been especially rewarding since Tenerifes’ nature is a paradise and there are so many things worth photographing on every trip. <i><a href="http://christianlerke.com" target="_blank">Visit Portfolio</a></i></p>
